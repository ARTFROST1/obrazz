## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### State Management Pattern

```
User Action → Store Update → Component Re-render
     ↓              ↓              ↓
  Gesture      pushHistory()   Canvas Update
```

### Data Flow

```
Canvas Gestures → Transform Updates → Store → Supabase
                       ↓
                  Undo/Redo Stack
```

### Component Hierarchy

```
CreateScreen
├── OutfitCanvas
│   └── CanvasItem (for each outfit item)
│       └── GestureDetector (pan, pinch, rotate, tap)
├── CategoryCarousel (×7 categories)
│   └── FlatList (horizontal)
└── BackgroundPicker (modal)
    └── ScrollView (colors & gradients)
```

## 🔧 Technical Stack Used

### Core Dependencies (Already Installed)

```json
{
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "~2.24.0",
  "react-native-reanimated": "~4.1.1",
  "zustand": "^5.0.3",
  "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.51.0",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^2.1.0"
}
```

### No New Dependencies Required ✅

All features implemented with existing packages from Stage 1-3.

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Design

- Clean, minimalist interface
- Black & white color scheme (per UI_UX_doc.md)
- Smooth spring animations
- Clear visual feedback
- Consistent spacing (4px grid system)

### Interaction Patterns

- Tap to select
- Drag to move
- Pinch to scale
- Rotate to turn
- Lock to protect
- Randomize to surprise

### User Feedback

- Loading states
- Success/error alerts
- Disabled button states
- Selection indicators
- Modal confirmations

---

## 🔒 Data Persistence

### What's Persisted

- ✅ Saved outfits (Supabase)
- ✅ Outfit metadata (Supabase)
- ✅ Canvas settings (AsyncStorage)
- ✅ Outfit collection (AsyncStorage)

### What's Ephemeral

- ❌ Current canvas state (resets on save/close)
- ❌ Undo/redo history (session only)
- ❌ Selected items (session only)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Not Implemented (As Planned)

1. **Image Export** - Postponed to Stage 8 (Polish & Optimization)
2. **Advanced Backgrounds** - Patterns/images marked premium (future)
3. **Collision Detection** - Not needed (creative freedom by design)
4. **Outfit Edit Mode** - Detail screen ready, edit can use create screen

### Technical Constraints

- Maximum 20 undo states (prevents memory issues)
- Scale range: 0.5x - 3x (prevents unusable sizes)
- Items stay within canvas bounds (user experience)
