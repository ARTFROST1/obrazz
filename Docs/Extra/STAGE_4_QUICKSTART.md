## 🐛 Common Issues

### TypeScript Errors

✅ Fixed - Using relative paths instead of `@types/` alias

### FlatList Warning

⚠️ Safe to ignore - "scrollToIndex out of range" handled with timeout

### Gesture Not Working

💡 Check that `react-native-gesture-handler` is wrapped in GestureHandlerRootView

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Lock Categories** - Lock items you like before randomizing
2. **Use Undo** - Experiment freely, undo mistakes instantly
3. **Layer Items** - Drag order determines z-index
4. **Save Often** - Create variations and compare
5. **Name Outfits** - Add descriptive titles when saving
