## 📖 Key Learnings

### What Went Well

1. **Planning:** Detailed documentation upfront saved time
2. **Incremental Approach:** Building components first, then screens
3. **Existing Code:** Services and stores were already complete
4. **Type Safety:** TypeScript caught issues early

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Import Issues:** Resolved by using relative imports for types
2. **Icon Names:** Found correct FontAwesome icon names
3. **Navigation Hooks:** Used useRouter properly in layout

### Best Practices Applied

1. Component composition over complexity
2. Reusable UI components (FAB, OutfitCard)
3. Separation of concerns (UI/Logic/State)
4. Dark mode from the start
5. Accessibility considerations

## 🎓 Developer Notes

### For Future Contributors

**To test the implementation:**

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd c:\Users\moroz\Desktop\AiWardrope\obrazz

# Start development server
npm start

# Or with Expo
npx expo start
```

**Key files to understand:**

1. `app/(tabs)/outfits.tsx` - Main screen logic
2. `components/outfit/OutfitCard.tsx` - Card UI
3. `app/outfit/create.tsx` - Create/edit logic
4. `services/outfit/outfitService.ts` - API calls

**Common tasks:**

- Add new filter: Update `filterBy` state in outfits.tsx
- Add new action: Add handler and pass to OutfitCard
- Change grid columns: Update `numColumns` in OutfitGrid
- Customize FAB: Edit FAB component props
