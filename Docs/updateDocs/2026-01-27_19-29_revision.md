## Inconsistencies fixed

- Updated all primary “source of truth” docs from Expo SDK 54 / RN 0.81.x to Expo SDK 55 (preview) / RN 0.83.1, matching current package.json.
- Removed README contradiction about “community feed”: description no longer claims a feed while scope explicitly excludes social features.
- Fixed broken README build links (now point to existing Docs/Extra/Build/\* files).
- Fixed broken Docs/README onboarding links (Quickstart/Checklist/Migrations/Pixian setup now point to real locations).
- Aligned Stage status across docs: Stage 4.13 is marked completed; Stage 5 is next.
- Corrected navigation behavior descriptions: Profile action is “settings/gear”, and Add screen hides the tab bar (iOS native NativeTabs `hidden`, Android tabBarStyle `display: none`).

## Removed / added

- Removed outdated/incorrect claims:
  - Expo CLI global install requirement in README.
  - NativeWind listed as installed in README.
  - “Vibrant community feed” wording in README.
- Added/updated content:
  - Current package versions (Expo 55 preview, RN 0.83.1, React 19.2.0, expo-router 55 beta, Reanimated/Gesture Handler) in the main docs.
  - Explicit “historical snapshot” note + current-version addendum in Docs/Implementation.md (Dec 2025 stats section) to prevent confusion.

## Rails backend updates (dashboard/admin)

- Documented that the Rails backend now includes a user dashboard (`/dashboard/*`) and a custom admin panel (`/admin/*`) implemented with Rails views + Tailwind + Hotwire.
- Clarified that Administrate/ActiveAdmin are optional; the currently implemented admin is custom and protected via HTTP Basic.
- Noted Zeitwerk constraint: `Admin` is reserved as a namespace; admin authentication model is `AdminUser` (table: `admins`).
- Added operational note for Supabase: `admins` table can be created via SQL (pgcrypto + bcrypt-compatible hash) when Rails migrations cannot run against the remote DB.
