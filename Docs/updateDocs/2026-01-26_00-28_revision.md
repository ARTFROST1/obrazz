# Documentation Consistency Revision Report

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-26 00:28
**Scope:** Hardening remaining Docs/Extra references that contradicted current project scope (Community removed).

## Summary

- Removed/flagged remaining Community-scope mentions in internal/team roadmap docs and historical stage summaries.
- Kept these documents usable as historical planning artifacts by adding explicit notes and/or marking Community as removed.

## Notes

- This pass intentionally focuses on preventing non-canonical Docs/Extra artifacts from contradicting the current “source of truth” docs.
- Canonical status/roadmap remains: `Docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `Docs/Implementation.md`, `Docs/TechStack.md`.
