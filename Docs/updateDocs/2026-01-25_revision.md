## Recommendations

1. **Keep package.json and TechStack.md in sync** - Consider adding a script to auto-generate version info

2. **Consolidate "Current Status" documents** - Multiple status docs in Docs/Extra/ may cause confusion

3. **Archive old stage completion docs** - Move to Docs/Extra/Archive/ to reduce clutter

4. **Regular quarterly reviews** - Schedule documentation audits to prevent drift
