## Fixed Inconsistencies

- Tech stack truthfulness: removed/flagged non-installed packages as planned; aligned versions with package.json (Expo/RN/testing/dev-client).
- Background removal provider: unified docs on Pixian.ai (code uses Pixian.ai via `services/wardrobe/backgroundRemover.ts`), deprecated legacy Remove.bg references.
- Stage narrative: aligned roadmap/status docs to Stage 4.12 complete and Stage 5 as The New Black AI; marked Stage 6 Community as removed.
- Broken links: fixed Docs/README.md to point to existing files/paths and added a canonical CURRENT_STATUS entry.

## Removed / Added

- Added: Docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md (new canonical status doc).
- Added: Docs/updateDocs/2026-01-26_12-30_revision.md (this report).
- Updated: multiple legacy docs now explicitly marked as deprecated to prevent them being treated as current sources of truth.
